  state:
    description:
    - The state the configuration should be left in
    - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any change on the
      device.
    - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to platform
      specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key within the result.
      For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is not required.
    - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
      it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and the
      value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
    - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and transforms
      it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the value is returned in
      the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config) option should be the
      same format as the output of command I(show running-config | include ip route|ipv6 route)
      executed on device. For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required.
